# MangoBrowser
MangoBrowser is a Sinatra web application that allows you to
easily browse [MangoPay's API](http://docs.mangopay.com/).

More screenshots [here](https://github.com/diacode/mangobrowser/tree/master/screenshots).

MangoBrowser idea and code is inspired by [BrowS3](https://github.com/tractical/brows3), an Amazon S3 API explorer, crafted by [Tractical](http://tractical.com).

## How does it work?
The app will ask you for your Client ID and Client Passphrase and if those credentials are for preproduction or production mode. Don't worry, no information is kept in any
database.

Once logged in you will be able to see the list of users and events. Inside each User and Event you can navigate to their associated objects (Wallets, Transactions, Refunds, Transfers, etc.)
